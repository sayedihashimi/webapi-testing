# Skill Routing Ownership Manifest

> **Historical document (fn-53, superseded by fn-64).** This manifest was generated before the flat layout migration (fn-56) and skill consolidation (fn-64). The 131 individual skills referenced here have been consolidated into 8 broad skills. Preserved for audit traceability only. Current canonical skill count is 8.

Generated for fn-53-skill-routing-language-hardening.1 (T1).
Each skill path maps to exactly one downstream editing task (T5-T10).
Zero overlaps: no skill path appears in two tasks.

## Task Distribution Summary

| Task | Title | Count | Categories |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| T5 (fn-53.5) | Normalize Foundation and High-Traffic Skills | 16 | agent-meta-skills, api-development, architecture, cicd, core-csharp, foundation, security, testing |
| T6 (fn-53.6) | Category Sweep - Core, Architecture | 30 | architecture, core-csharp |
| T7 (fn-53.7) | Category Sweep - API, Security, Testing, CI | 26 | api-development, cicd, security, testing |
| T8 (fn-53.8) | Category Sweep - UI, NativeAOT, TUI, MultiTarget | 24 | ai, localization, multi-targeting, native-aot, tui, ui-frameworks |
| T9 (fn-53.9) | Category Sweep - Long Tail | 34 | build-system, cli-tools, documentation, packaging, performance, project-structure, release-management, serialization |
| T10 (fn-53.10) | Agent File Normalization | 14 | agents |
| **Total** | | **131 skills + 14 agents** | |

**Distribution rationale**: T9 (34) exceeds the ~30 target because it collects 8 distinct low-coupling categories (build-system, cli-tools, documentation, packaging, performance, project-structure, release-management, serialization). Moving skills to other tasks would break the natural category grouping and introduce cross-category ownership splits. The skills in T9 are lower-traffic and simpler to normalize, so the higher count does not increase sweep difficulty proportionally.
