## Section Migration Pattern

The normalization applied a consistent structural change across all skills in the catalog at the time (130; now 131):

| Change | Count | Migration |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `Scope` section added | 130 | New section -- skills had no explicit scope boundary |
| `Out of scope` section added | 130 | New section -- skills had no explicit out-of-scope boundary |
| `Overview / Scope Boundary` dropped | 5 | Split into separate `Scope` + `Out of scope` sections |
| `Scope Boundary` dropped | 1 | Split into separate `Scope` + `Out of scope` sections |
| `Activation Guidance` added | 1 | New section in dotnet-csharp-coding-standards |
| `Immediate Routing Actions (Do First)` added | 1 | New section in dotnet-advisor |
| `Default Quality Rule` added | 1 | New section in dotnet-advisor |

**Zero sections were dropped without a documented migration target.**
All 6 dropped sections (`Overview / Scope Boundary` x5, `Scope Boundary` x1) were split into dedicated `Scope` and `Out of scope` sections that preserve the original content.

## Description Changes

128 of the 130 skills at the time had their descriptions reworded to follow the canonical style guide:

- **Verb-led format**: Descriptions start with a present-tense verb (e.g., "Configures", "Implements", "Routes")
- **Budget-neutral or budget-negative**: Total description chars decreased from ~12,345 to 11,595
- **Factual tone**: Removed promotional/assertive cues ("WHEN", "WHEN NOT" prefixes)
- **Cross-reference syntax**: Routing targets use `[skill:name]` syntax in descriptions where applicable

## Advisor Catalog Status

All 20 category status markers in the `dotnet-advisor` skill catalog were verified; 14 required changes (12 `planned`→`implemented`, 2 `(none)`→`implemented`). The remaining 6 were already `implemented`:

| Category | Previous Status | Current Status |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1. Foundation & Plugin Infrastructure | `implemented` | `implemented` |
| 2. Core C# & Language Patterns | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 3. Project Structure & Scaffolding | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 4. Architecture Patterns | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 5. Serialization & Communication | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 6. API Development | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 7. Security | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 8. Testing | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 9. Performance & Benchmarking | `implemented` | `implemented` |
| 10. Native AOT & Trimming | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 11. CLI Tool Development | `(none)` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 12. UI Frameworks | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 13. Multi-Targeting & Polyfills | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 14. Localization & Internationalization | `implemented` | `implemented` |
| 15. Packaging & Publishing | `implemented` | `implemented` |
| 16. Release Management | `implemented` | `implemented` |
| 17. CI/CD | `implemented` | `implemented` |
| 18. Documentation | `implemented` | `implemented` |
| 19. Agent Meta-Skills | `planned` | `implemented` (updated) |
| 20. AI & LLM Integration | `(none)` | `implemented` (updated) |

## Agent Modifications

12 of 14 agent files were modified. 2 agents (dotnet-architect, dotnet-blazor-specialist) were unchanged.

| Agent | Description | Bare Refs | [skill:] Refs | Sections |
|-------|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| dotnet-architect | unchanged | 0->0 | 7->7 | unchanged |
| dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist | reworded | 3->0 | 7->13 | unchanged |
| dotnet-async-performance-specialist | reworded | 3->0 | 5->10 | unchanged |
| dotnet-benchmark-designer | reworded | 1->0 | 6->7 | unchanged |
| dotnet-blazor-specialist | unchanged | 0->0 | 18->18 | unchanged |
| dotnet-cloud-specialist | reworded | 3->0 | 9->15 | unchanged |
| dotnet-code-review-agent | reworded | 9->0 | 7->16 | unchanged |
| dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist | reworded | 0->0 | 3->4 | unchanged |
| dotnet-docs-generator | reworded | 0->0 | 12->12 | unchanged |
| dotnet-maui-specialist | reworded | 0->0 | 17->17 | unchanged |
| dotnet-performance-analyst | reworded | 1->0 | 10->11 | unchanged |
| dotnet-security-reviewer | reworded | 0->0 | 7->7 | unchanged |
| dotnet-testing-specialist | reworded | 5->0 | 8->15 | unchanged |
| dotnet-uno-specialist | reworded | 0->0 | 19->19 | unchanged |

Note: "Bare Refs" counts use the validator's `find_bare_refs()` rules, which only flag backtick-wrapped tokens matching known skill or agent IDs. Frontmatter, pure-ID headings, and non-skill CLI tool names (e.g., `dotnet-counters`) are excluded, so counts may differ from the T1 baseline audit's broader regex methodology.

## Similarity Verification

| Metric | Pre-Sweep Baseline | Post-Sweep |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Total items | 144 | 144 |
| Total pairs | 10,296 | 10,296 |
| Max composite score | 0.5429 | 0.5416 |
| WARN pairs (>= 0.55) | 0 | 0 |
| ERROR pairs (>= 0.75) | 0 | 0 |
| Suppressed pairs | 1 | 1 |
| New WARNs vs baseline | n/a | 0 |

Max similarity score decreased slightly (0.5429 -> 0.5416), confirming descriptions were differentiated rather than homogenized.

## Validation Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `validate-skills.sh` | PASSED (0 errors, 10 warnings — all match committed baseline, no new warnings) |
| `validate-marketplace.sh` | PASSED (0 errors, 0 warnings) |
| Broken cross-references | 0 |
| Self-referential cross-links | 0 |
| ID collisions (skill vs agent) | 0 |
| Description budget | 11,595 < 12,000 (OK) |
| BUDGET_STATUS | OK |
| SELF_REF_COUNT | 0 |
| AGENT_BARE_REF_COUNT | 0 |
| AGENTSMD_BARE_REF_COUNT | 0 |
