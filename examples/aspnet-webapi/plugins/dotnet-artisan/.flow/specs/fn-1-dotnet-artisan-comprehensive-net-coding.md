## Critical Architectural Decisions

### Context Budget Strategy (resolves gap: 100 skills vs 15,000 char limit)
- **Router/advisor skill** contains a compressed catalog (~50 chars per skill = ~5,000 chars for 100 skills)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Only name+description loaded initially; full SKILL.md on invoke
- **MCP Tool Search**: Auto-activates when >10% context consumed (96% reduction)
- **Validate in fn-2**: First task must prototype router skill and verify budget math

### Hook Performance Strategy (resolves gap: <5s vs dotnet format)
- `dotnet format` runs in **background** with results reported on next interaction
- `dotnet restore` runs **async** after .csproj edits
- Only **fast validation** (<1s) runs synchronously (XAML syntax, frontmatter check)
- Configurable aggressiveness: low (nothing sync), moderate (fast checks), aggressive (all sync)
- **Concurrency controls** (required for reliability):
  - Per-project job coalescing: rapid edits debounce into single format/restore run
  - Cancellation: new edit cancels in-flight background format for same file
  - Per-solution serialization: only one `dotnet restore` per solution at a time
  - Stale-result suppression: discard diagnostics from runs that started before latest edit

### Version Detection Strategy (resolves gap: multi-targeting, caching)
- Detection runs **on first .NET file encounter** per session
- Caches per-project (keyed by solution/project path)
- Multi-targeting: **highest TFM** drives guidance, with polyfill callouts for lower TFMs
- Inconsistent files: **warn agent**, use most specific (.csproj TFM over global.json)

### Cross-Agent Feature Matrix (resolves gap: feature parity)
| Feature                | Claude Code     | Copilot             | Codex                   |
|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Skills                 | Full SKILL.md   | .github/skills/     | AGENTS.md sections      |
| Agents                 | Full subagents  | N/A (no equivalent) | Multi-agent worktrees   |
| Hooks                  | Full hooks.json | N/A                 | N/A                     |
| MCP                    | .mcp.json       | VS Code MCP         | N/A                     |
| Progressive disclosure | Native          | Via applyTo         | Via directory hierarchy |

Skills degrade gracefully: Claude-specific features (hooks, MCP, agents) are omitted from Copilot/Codex formats. Core skill guidance is identical across all agents.

## Execution Strategy
- **Ralph loop swarm** executes Wave 0 first
- On fn-2 completion, all Wave 1 epics unblock and execute in parallel
- Wave 2-3 epics are detailed via **plan-sync** after Wave 1 implementation
- RP review focuses on fn-2 and Wave 1 correctness

## Quick commands
```bash
# List all dotnet-artisan epics
.flow/bin/flowctl epics

# Check what's ready to work on
.flow/bin/flowctl ready --epic fn-2

# Start foundation work
.flow/bin/flowctl start fn-2.1
```

## Acceptance
- [ ] All 24 sub-epics created with proper dependency links
- [ ] Wave 0 (fn-2) fully detailed with task specs
- [ ] Wave 1 epics have task breakdowns
- [ ] Wave 2-3 epics have titles and lightweight specs
- [ ] RP review passes for Wave 0-1
- [ ] Epic dependency graph matches Wave classification (no wave label contradicts dependency edges)
- [ ] Cross-agent conformance tests defined in fn-24 (routing, trigger, fallback scenarios)
- [ ] Technical claims in spec have source URLs and "last verified" dates
- [ ] Hook concurrency controls specified (debounce, cancellation, serialization)
