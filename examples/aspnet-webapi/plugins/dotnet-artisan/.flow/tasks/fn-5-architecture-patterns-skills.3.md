# fn-5-architecture-patterns-skills.3 Observability skill

## Description
Create `dotnet-observability` skill covering OpenTelemetry (traces, metrics, logs), Serilog/MS.Extensions.Logging structured logging, health checks, and custom metrics.

## Acceptance
- [ ] `skills/architecture/dotnet-observability/SKILL.md` exists with `name` and `description` frontmatter
- [ ] Covers OpenTelemetry setup for traces/metrics/logs plus structured logging
- [ ] Covers health check patterns (referenced by container skills)
- [ ] Contains out-of-scope boundary statements (testing → fn-7)
- [ ] Deferred cross-ref placeholder for fn-7 `dotnet-integration-testing` (non-blocking)
- [ ] Skill `name` value is unique repo-wide
- [ ] Does NOT modify `plugin.json` (handled by fn-5.6)

## Done summary
Created `dotnet-observability` skill covering OpenTelemetry (traces, metrics, logs), structured logging (MS.Extensions.Logging source generators + Serilog), health checks (liveness vs readiness), and custom metrics via `System.Diagnostics.Metrics`. This task only modified `skills/architecture/dotnet-observability/SKILL.md` — no other skill files were edited, preserving the file-disjoint parallelizable constraint.
