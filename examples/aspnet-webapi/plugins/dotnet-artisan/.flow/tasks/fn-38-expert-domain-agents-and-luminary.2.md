# fn-38-expert-domain-agents-and-luminary.2 Create dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist agent (Fowler-grounded)

## Description
Create `agents/dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist.md` — a domain-named agent for ASP.NET Core architecture, middleware, and backend design patterns, grounded in David Fowler's expertise.

**Size:** M
**Files:** `agents/dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

## Approach
- Follow agent frontmatter pattern from `agents/dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist.md`
- Agent name: `dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist` (domain name, NOT person name)
- Include "Knowledge Sources" section citing Fowler's AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios repo, Andrew Lock's middleware blog series, and official ASP.NET Core documentation
- Include disclaimer language
- Preloaded skills: `dotnet-minimal-apis`, `dotnet-api-security`, `dotnet-architecture-patterns`, `dotnet-resilience`, `dotnet-http-client`, `dotnet-csharp-dependency-injection`
- Decision tree covering: middleware vs endpoint filter, minimal APIs vs controllers, DI lifetime selection, request pipeline optimization, diagnostic scenario identification
- Explicit boundaries: "Does NOT handle Blazor/Razor (use blazor-specialist)", "Does NOT handle security auditing (use security-reviewer)", "Does NOT handle async performance internals (use async-performance-specialist)"
- Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (analysis only)
- Model: sonnet
- Keep under 3,000 tokens total
- Register in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` agents array

## Key context
- David Fowler's AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios covers async guidance, middleware anti-patterns, DI pitfalls. The agent should distill these into decision rules.
- Andrew Lock's blog series "Exploring ASP.NET Core" provides deep middleware and configuration patterns.
- This agent complements dotnet-architect (which is a routing/architecture agent) by providing deep ASP.NET Core-specific analysis.
- Fowler also maintains dotnet-skillz Claude Code plugin — reference for patterns but adapt to our structure.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Agent file created at `agents/dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist.md`
- [ ] Frontmatter includes name, description, model (sonnet), capabilities, tools
- [ ] "Knowledge Sources" section cites Fowler's diagnostic scenarios, Lock's blog, official docs
- [ ] Disclaimer language included
- [ ] Decision tree covers middleware vs endpoint filter, minimal APIs vs controllers, DI lifetimes
- [ ] Explicit boundaries: no overlap with blazor-specialist, security-reviewer, async-performance-specialist
- [ ] Preloaded skills listed with `[skill:...]` cross-references
- [ ] Agent under 3,000 tokens
- [ ] Registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` agents array
- [ ] All four validation commands pass
## Done summary
Created dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist agent grounded in David Fowler's AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios and Andrew Lock's blog series, with decision trees covering middleware vs endpoint filters, minimal APIs vs controllers, DI lifetime selection, request pipeline optimization, and diagnostic scenarios. Registered in plugin.json.
