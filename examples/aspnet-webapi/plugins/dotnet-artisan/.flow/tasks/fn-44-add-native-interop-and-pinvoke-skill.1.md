# fn-44-add-native-interop-and-pinvoke-skill.1 Author dotnet-native-interop SKILL.md

## Description
Author `skills/core-csharp/dotnet-native-interop/SKILL.md` covering P/Invoke and native interop across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and WASM.

**Visibility:** Implicit (agent-loaded, not user-invocable)
**Size:** M
**Files:** `skills/core-csharp/dotnet-native-interop/SKILL.md`

## Approach

- Follow existing skill pattern at `skills/native-aot/dotnet-native-aot/SKILL.md` for style
- Cover `[LibraryImport]` (.NET 7+, preferred) vs `[DllImport]` (legacy)
- Platform sections: Windows DLL, macOS/Linux .so/.dylib, iOS static linking
- WASM: single line noting P/Invoke not supported, cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-aot-wasm]` for JS interop — do NOT cover JSImport/JSExport in detail
- Cover marshalling: structs, strings, function pointers, `NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver`
- Target description ~90 chars
- Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke

## Key context

- iOS does not allow dynamic library loading — must use static linking
- `dotnet-native-aot` keeps AOT-specific P/Invoke; this skill owns general guidance
- `CsWin32` stays in `dotnet-winui` — just add a cross-reference
- WASM JSImport/JSExport is JavaScript interop, not native interop — out of scope
## Approach

- Follow existing skill pattern at `skills/native-aot/dotnet-native-aot/SKILL.md` for style
- Cover `[LibraryImport]` (.NET 7+, preferred) vs `[DllImport]` (legacy)
- Platform sections: Windows DLL, macOS/Linux .so/.dylib, iOS static linking, WASM `[JSImport]` note
- Cover marshalling: structs, strings, function pointers, `NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver`
- Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke

## Key context

- iOS does not allow dynamic library loading — must use static linking
- WASM has no traditional P/Invoke — uses `[JSImport]`/`[JSExport]` instead (mention, cross-ref)
- `dotnet-native-aot` lines 181-226 keep AOT-specific P/Invoke; this skill owns general guidance
- `CsWin32` stays in `dotnet-winui` — just add a cross-reference
## Acceptance
- [ ] SKILL.md exists at `skills/core-csharp/dotnet-native-interop/`
- [ ] Valid frontmatter with `name` and `description` (under 120 chars, ~90 target)
- [ ] Covers LibraryImport vs DllImport with decision guidance
- [ ] Platform-specific sections for Windows, macOS/Linux, iOS, Android
- [ ] WASM: single-line limitation note with cross-ref to dotnet-aot-wasm
- [ ] Covers marshalling patterns (structs, strings, callbacks)
- [ ] Covers NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver
- [ ] Cross-reference syntax used for related skills
## Done summary
Authored dotnet-native-interop SKILL.md covering P/Invoke patterns: LibraryImport vs DllImport decision guidance, platform-specific sections (Windows/macOS/Linux/iOS/Android/WASM), NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver for cross-platform resolution, marshalling patterns (structs, strings, callbacks, SafeHandle), cross-platform data type mapping, and 8 Agent Gotchas.
