# fn-29-fleet-skill-review-and-improvement-sweep.12 Final validation and context budget check

## Description

Final gating step after all improvements from tasks 9-11 are merged. Run all four validation commands, verify context budget stays under thresholds, check all cross-references resolve correctly, and update shared files (plugin.json, AGENTS.md, README.md) if any skills were added/removed/renamed during improvement implementation. Clean up review reports — keep consolidated-findings.md for reference, archive or remove individual batch-{a..f}-findings.md reports.

**File ownership:** This task is the sole owner of modifications to `plugin.json`, `AGENTS.md`, and `README.md`. All shared-file updates (skill counts, routing index, catalog) happen here.

### Files

- **Validation:** `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`, `./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh`, `python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict`, `python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py`
- **Shared files (sole owner):** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`
- **Cleanup:** `docs/review-reports/batch-{a..f}-findings.md` (archive or remove), keep `docs/review-reports/consolidated-findings.md`

## Acceptance
- [ ] `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes
- [ ] `./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh` passes
- [ ] `python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict` passes
- [ ] `python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py` passes
- [ ] Total description budget < 15,000 chars (warn if > 12,000)
- [ ] All `[skill:name]` cross-references resolve to existing skills
- [ ] plugin.json skill count matches actual skill directories on disk
- [ ] AGENTS.md skill counts updated if changed
- [ ] Batch findings reports archived or removed; consolidated findings retained

## Done summary
Registered 2 missing multi-targeting skills in plugin.json (99->101), trimmed 3 over-budget descriptions to under 120 chars, updated skill counts and categories across AGENTS.md/README.md/CLAUDE.md (97->101 skills, 18->19 categories, Core C# 7->9), removed 6 batch findings reports retaining consolidated-findings.md. All four validation commands pass; context budget at 11,349/15,000 chars.
