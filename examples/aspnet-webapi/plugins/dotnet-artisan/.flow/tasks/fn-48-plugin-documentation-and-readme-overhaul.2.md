# fn-48-plugin-documentation-and-readme-overhaul.2 Verify documentation counts and validation after fn-48.1 reconciliation
<!-- Updated by plan-sync: fn-48.1 already rewrote README with install, overview, agents, and reviewed CONTRIBUTING files; scope reduced to verification -->

## Description
Verify all documentation changes from fn-48.1 pass validation and cross-check counts are consistent.

**Size:** S (verification only)
**Files:** None (read-only verification)

## Approach

- Run all four validation scripts
- Spot-check 3-4 skill categories in README against plugin.json
- Verify no stale counts remain (canonical count is now 127 skills, 14 agents, 22 categories)
<!-- Updated by plan-sync: fn-48.1 used 127 skills not the originally planned 132 -->

## Acceptance
- [ ] All four validation scripts pass
- [ ] Spot-check confirms README matches plugin.json (127 skills, 14 agents)
## Done summary
Verified all documentation changes from fn-48.1: all four CI validation steps pass (validate-skills.sh, validate-marketplace.sh, JSON validity, root marketplace resolution), and spot-checked that 127 skills / 14 agents / 22 categories are consistent across plugin.json, README.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md. No stale counts (122 or 132) remain in published documentation.
